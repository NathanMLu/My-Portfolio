Content is more important than the design! Write the actual content first...

Text-box to talk to AI - centered on screen, minimize

Food Theme:
- random food drops from top on scroll, sfx when it hits the bottom. Start a pile at the bottom, use 2d?
- White background, Apple style font
- Move mouth based on mouse position x

- Scroll and generates new foods, some sort of interaction with swipe to move them,
- Make the food a game,

Themes:
- Professional, clean, just normal
- 3d space background, what I had originally
- Food/Music related, more in the middle ground

About:
- Who am i, rough backstory, keep it short
- Skills, put icons of different technologies
- Add links for achievements
- How I started?

IDEAS FOR 3d Background:
    - Have a bunch of 3d objects floating aimlessly around the screen,
    mouse pushes them to the side

    - 3d cubes that show more elements, fall from top when scrolling

    - Scroll forward, through tunnels, space, etc.

    - Move drone/spaceship/car left or right based on mouse position, some
    sort of endless runner, need to make it less distracting

    - Bubbles/ spheres bouncing around change content when scrolling


FINAL IDEA:
     - Bubbles rush to mouse cursor, when you hover on certain items,
     their texture changes, ie change into drones, etc.
