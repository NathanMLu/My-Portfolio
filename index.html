                    I'm Nate, an aspiring software engineer living in
                    <span>
                        Austin, Texas.
                    </span>
                    My journey with code began when I decided to automate my electronics
                    <a href="https://www.ebay.com/usr/tech4all_official">
                        resale business
                    </a>
                    because manually entering sales and looking for new products was becoming too time-consuming.

                    <br><br>

                    My love of learning has led me to work with many aspects of software development, but I've had
                    the most experience in machine learning, web & app development, and scripting. As a full-time
                    <a href="https://www.austincc.edu/">
                        student,
                    </a>
                    I keep myself occupied with personal and group projects, as well as positions of leadership in
                    various
                    <a href="https://austincc.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/acc_csso">

                    </a>

                    <br><br>

                    I'm the sort of person that never gives up, no matter how much a <span>bug</span> makes me want to
                    rip
                    my hair out. With my experience in contract-based projects, as well as a number
                    of group projects during
                    <a href="https://devpost.com/nathanlumax">
                        hackathons,
                    </a>
                    I'm looking for an internship or part-time position to utilize my experience and
                    expand my knowledge.
